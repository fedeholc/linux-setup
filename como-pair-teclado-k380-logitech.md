The author of the question provided the following solution.

Install bluetoothctl if it is not already installed. In Ubuntu 20.04 it comes with the default install.

In terminal, run the command bluetoothctl:

$ bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[MX Vertical]# agent on
Agent is already registered
Start the scan:

[MX Vertical]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller DC:53:60:0E:0A:C8 Discovering: yes
[CHG] Device 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 RSSI: -49
[CHG] Device 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 Class: 0x00002540
[CHG] Device 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 Icon: input-keyboard
[CHG] Device 88:0F:10:87:00:F1 RSSI: -87
In this output, the MAC address of the keyboard is this one: 34:88:5D:EF:19:51. Copy it! Then stop the scan:

[MX Vertical]# scan off
[CHG] Device 88:0F:10:87:00:F1 RSSI is nil
[CHG] Device 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 RSSI is nil
[CHG] Controller DC:53:60:0E:0A:C8 Discovering: no
Discovery stopped
Trust the device with:

[MX Vertical]# trust 34:88:5D:EF:19:51
[CHG] Device 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 Trusted: yes
Changing 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 trust succeeded
And pair it. Now the passkey shown in terminal (300892 in this case) must be typed in keyboard, and after that an Enter should be pressed. It'll looks like this:

[MX Vertical]# pair 34:88:5D:EF:19:51
Attempting to pair with 34:88:5D:EF:19:51
[CHG] Device 34:88:5D:EF:19:51 Connected: yes
[agent] Passkey: 300892
[agent] Passkey:  00892

[agent] Passkey:    892
[agent] Passkey:     92
[agent] Passkey:      2
[agent] Passkey:         
Hit Enter now.
